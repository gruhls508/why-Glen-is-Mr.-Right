      <h2>The Qualifications of Glen Ruhl</h2>
        <h4><i>Why I am a solid candidate for Launch Academy’s Web Developer program…</i></h4>
          <b>Intellectual capability</b> – I maintained an academic scholarship through 4 years of undergrad at Franklin & Marshall, a Top 50 Liberal Arts college. 
          <br> 
          <b>Diverse abilities</b> – My degree is in Creative Writing, though I have 2+ years of experience in CAD and Workplace Safety. I also now have almost a year’s experience in Special Education and Human Services. 
          <br> 
          <b>An all-around good guy</b> – My answer to the classic interview question of "What would you say is one of your weaknesses?" is that I'm too nice. In all seriousness, this is because I have great empathy and make every effort to understand where the other guy (or gal) is coming from. In today's world, working well with others is key.
